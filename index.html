    <h2>Our History</h2>
    <p>
      Berea Women’s Club was organized on June 19, 1919 at the Berea Baptist Church by a group of women from the Berea community.  The purpose of the organization “was to bring together women of this area of Madison County for mutual counsel and helpfulness and create a united effort for the welfare of the community while contributing to the best interests of humanity as a whole” (Engle, F.  2011 January 1.

      According to Fred Engle, “(t)he first meeting of the Club was called to order by Mrs. W. J. Herndon, president of the Berea Progress Club.  Elected for two years terms were the following officers – President, Mrs. Scott T. McGuire; First Vice President, Mrs. William J. Baird; Second Vice President, Mrs. J. J. Osborne; Recording Secretary, Mrs. George G. Dick; Corresponding Secretary, Mrs. W. G. Best; and Treasurer, Mrs. Frank M. Livingood. Mrs. R. J. Crowley chaired the constitutional committee.  There were 49 charter members, and by the end of the first year membership in the club was over 100” (Engle, F. 2011 January 1. The Berea Women’s Club and the Echo Club, The Richmond Register.
